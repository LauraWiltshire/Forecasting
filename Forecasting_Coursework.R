# Welcome to my Forecasting Coursework

# Part 1: Manual Modelling
# This uses quaterly time series data from the M3 competition (package Mcomp)
# My student ID ends in a 3, so the Series ID I will use is 1357.
# I shall manually select three models, for fitting data and producing forecasts.
# One regression model (with trend and seasonality components)
# One exponential smoothing model
# One ARIMA model
# I will perform data exploration using graphs, 
# statistical descriptive summaries,
# and statistical tests.
# This includes residual diagnostics, prediction intervals (80% and 95% CI)
# for the next 8 quaters
