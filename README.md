# Forecasting Project

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This is a project for comparing different forecasting models using R. It utilises time-series data from the M3 competition package (MComp). Source: http://forecasters.org/resources/time-series-data/m3-competition/.

## Part 1: Manual Modelling
Part 1 of the project uses the time-series with the ID 1357. This quarterly data is under the category "demographic", measuring employment in Finland from 1978 to 1996. It is a time series of length n = 62 for historical data, and length h = 8 for the future data.

## Part 2: Batch Forecasting
Part 2 uses the time-series with the IDs 1001 to 1100. These sets are quarterly data in the category "macro". 
* One of the time series lengths is n = 14 for historical data, and h = 8 for future data. 
* Five of the time series lengths are n = 26 for historical data, and h = 8 for future data. 
* Ninety-four of the time series lengths are n = 44 for historical data, and h = 8 for future data.
